For first, we analyze the First Come First Served (FCFS) scheduling policy. 
In the next section we will analyze the Shortest Job First (SJF) policy and compare
the two scenarios.
\subsubsection{Turnaround time}

The first metric to be analyzed is the turnaround time.
From \cref{fig:fcfsTurnEcdf} and \cref{fig:fcfsTurnDensity} we can see that a larger utilization of the CPUs $\rho$ 
skews the distribution of turnaround time to the right. This can be explained 
by the fact that the more the CPUs are utilized, the more probable is for a
process to be queued and to wait more.
The effects of $\rho$ are more pronounced with fewer CPUs (as expected), and a higher 
\texttt{pCpuBound}. In fact, with a higher \texttt{pCpuBound} a process spends 
most of its time in the CPU, increasing the probability of forming a queue of 
ready processes.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \captionsetup{type=figure}

    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{./images/04/fcfs/turn/ecdf.png}
    \caption{Empirical CDF of the turnaround time of the systems.}
    \label{fig:fcfsTurnEcdf}
\end{figure}

The empirical probability density function of the turnaround time, shown
in \cref{fig:fcfsTurnDensity}, confirms the previous observations. Comparing
the plot above to the right with the others, we can observe that
the distribution is more uniform and skewed to the right when $\rho$ is higher,
the processes are more likely CPU bound and there are few CPUs. In this case, 
the turnaround time can be modeled as the sum of the waiting time in the queue with the 
service time of the process. 

When, instead, the utilization and the \texttt{pCpuBound} are lower and the 
number of CPUs is higher, the distribution is approximately an exponential:
in this case the effects of queueing are less pronounced and the turnaround time
is mainly determined by the (exponential) service time of the process.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \captionsetup{type=figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{./images/04/fcfs/turn/density.png}
    \caption{Density plot of the turnaround time of the systems.}
    \label{fig:fcfsTurnDensity}
\end{figure}

From the lorenz curve in \cref{fig:fcfsTurnLorenz} we can see that the 
distribution that the turnaround time assumes with bigger $\rho$ is more fair 
than the one with smaller $\rho$. We can explain this by the fact that when the
system is more utilized, the processes are more likely to be queued and to wait
a similar amount of time, making the distribution more fair.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \captionsetup{type=figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{./images/04/fcfs/turn/lorenz.png}
    \caption{Lorenz curve of the turnaround time of the systems.}
    \label{fig:fcfsTurnLorenz}
\end{figure}

In \cref{fig:fcfsTurnAutocorrelation} we see 
that larger $\rho$ values make the distribution more correlated, while more 
CPUs and a lower \texttt{pCpuBound} make the distribution less correlated.

This fits perfectly with the model: when the system is more utilized, the
processes are more likely to be queued, so the waiting time of
each process will be closely related to the one of its nearest 
processes in the queue, making the distribution
more correlated. When the system is less utilized, the processes are more likely
to be served immediately, making the distribution dependent only on the service
time of the process.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \captionsetup{type=figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{./images/04/fcfs/turn/autocorrelation.png}
    \caption{Autocorrelation plot of the turnaround time of the systems.}
    \label{fig:fcfsTurnAutocorrelation}
\end{figure}

After using subsampling to make the data uncorrelated, we used bootstrap to calculate the confidence intervals of the mean and the standard deviation of the turnaround time. The \texttt{std dev} was calculated since we expect it to be equal to the mean when the distribution is exponential. It can be seen in \cref{tab:fcfsTurn} that for small $\rho$ they are similar.

    \input{./tables/4/fcfsTurn.tex}
    \caption{Bootstrap results for turnaround time mean and Std Dev. (ms)}
    \label{tab:fcfsTurn}
\end{table}


\subsubsection{Waiting time}

From \cref{fig:fcfsWaitEcdf} and \cref{fig:fcfsWaitDensity} it is clear to see that for $\rho = 0.5$ the waiting time is almost always $0$. For this reason in \cref{fig:fcfsWaitLorenz} we see that the waiting time is more unfair when $\rho$ is lower, since this is the behaviour of the line of maximum unfairness (all values$ = 0$ except for one). In \cref{fig:fcfsWaitAutocorrelation} we see that even when $\rho = 0.5$ the times are really correlated.

\end{table}


\subsubsection{CPU utilization}

\label{sec:fcfsCpuUtilization}

\begin{table}[H]

    \scriptsize
    \input{./tables/4/fcfsCpus.tex}
    \caption{Mean and Std Dev of number of busy cpus.}
    \label{tab:fcfsCpus}
\end{table}

We see that the obtained values are inline with the theoretical model:
\begin{equation}
    \rho * numCpus = meanCpuUtilized
\end{equation}


For example $0.9 * 4 \approx 3.61$
