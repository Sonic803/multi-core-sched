\subsubsection{Turnaround time}

From \cref{fig:fcfsTurnEcdf} and \cref{fig:fcfsTurnDensity} we can see that a larger $\rho$ skews the distribution of turnaround time to the right. The effects of $\rho$ are more pronounced with fewer CPUs, and a higher \texttt{pCpuBound}. This can be explained by the fact that, with a higher \texttt{pCpuBound} a process spends most of its time in the CPU, increasing the probability of forming a queue of ready processes.

    \caption{Density plot of the turnaround time of the systems.}
    \label{fig:fcfsTurnDensity}
\end{figure}

From the lorenz curve in \cref{fig:fcfsTurnLorenz} we can see that the distribution that the turnaround time assumes with bigger $\rho$ is more fair than the one with smaller $\rho$. In \cref{fig:fcfsTurnAutocorrelation} we see that larger $\rho$ values make the distribution more correlated, while more CPUs and a lower \texttt{pCpuBound} make the distribution less correlated.

\end{figure}

\newpage
After using subsampling to make the data uncorrelated, we used bootstrap to calculate the confidence intervals of the mean and the standard deviation of the turnaround time. The \texttt{std dev} was calculated since we excpect it to be equal to the mean when the distribution is exponential. It can be seen in \cref{tab:fcfsTurn} that for small $\rho$ they are similar.

\subsubsection{Waiting time}

From \cref{fig:fcfsWaitEcdf} and \cref{fig:fcfsWaitDensity} it is clear to see that for $\rho = 0.5$ the waiting time is almost always $0$. For this reason in \cref{fig:fcfsWaitLorenz} we see that the waiting time is more unfair when $\rho$ is lower, since this is the behaviour of the line of maximum unfairness (all values$ = 0$ except for one). In \cref{fig:fcfsWaitAutocorrelation} we see that even when $\rho = 0.5$ the times are really correlated.

\subsubsection{CPU utilization}

    \input{./tables/4/fcfsCpus.tex}
    \caption{Mean and Std Dev of number of busy cpus.}
    \label{tab:fcfsCpus}
\end{table}

We see that the obtained values are inline with the theoretical model:
\begin{equation}
    \rho * numCpus = meanCpuUtilized
\end{equation}


For example $0.9 * 4 \approx 3.61$
