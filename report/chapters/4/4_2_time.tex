\subsection{Warm-up period}

To determine the warm-up period, we observed the development of the mean number of busy CPUs over time, through 10 independent runs and with different parameters configurations. The number of busy CPUs is a good indicator of the system's stability, as it doesn't depend on the scheduling policy.
Our observations showed that the system stabilizes well before \SI{200}{\second} in all tested configurations. To handle variability and ensure robustness in worse cases, we set the warm-up period to \SI{200}{\second}.

\subsection{Simulation duration}

For the simulation duration, we chose to end it at \SI{1000}{\second}. This ensures that after discarding the initial \SI{200}{\second} warm-up period, there remains \SI{800}{\second} of simulation data for analysis. Given that the mean generation time is on the order of tenths of a second, this duration strikes a balance between obtaining statistically meaningful results even after subsampling and maintaining reasonable simulation times.
